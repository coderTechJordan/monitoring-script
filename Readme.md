# System Metrics Monitoring Script

This bash script is designed to monitor system metrics,
log files, and services for a Linux system. This script
gathers information about CPU usage, memory usage, disk space,
log files, and services, and outputs the results to a metrics file (`metrix.txt`).

This script uses
`top`
`free`
`df`
`grep`
`awk`
`service`
